This is the final project of the Getting and Cleaning Data course of the Data Science Specialization of coursera. The repository contains:

An R script, "run_analysis.R", that does the following: 1.1 Downloads the dataset into a "run_analysis" directory in the working directory, and creates it if does not already exist, and unzips the downloaded file. 1.2 Reads the activity, feature, training and test data. 1.3 Merges training and test data, and assigns acitivities, features and subjects as the columns names of this merge 1.4 Extracts mean and standard deviation from merge. 1.5 Gives a descriptive activity name. 1.6 Labels with descriptive variables. 1.7 Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.

The tidy dataset "tidy_data.txt" from 1.7

A codebook, "CodeBook.md" that indicate he variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
